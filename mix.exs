        Help applications do things to themselves (ex. kill themselves).

        files change on disk (i.e. a gentle `touch` is enough), then the given action
        is fired over the app. `Harakiri` was concieved to help applications kill
        themselves in response to a `touch` to a file on disk. Hence the name.
